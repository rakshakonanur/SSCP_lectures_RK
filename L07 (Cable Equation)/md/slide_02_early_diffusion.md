## Lord Kelvin's Work

**William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin)** developed the first mathematical model to understand signal behavior in submarine telegraph cables.

### The Diffusion Approach
- Modeled signal propagation as a diffusion process, similar to heat conduction
- Applied mathematical techniques from heat transfer theory
- Focused on understanding signal attenuation over distance

### Observed Limitations
- Could not fully explain observed delays and signal degradation in long cables
- Model predictions didn't match experimental results for transatlantic cables
- Missing key physical phenomena in signal transmission

### Historical Context
The first transatlantic telegraph cable attempts were driving the need for better understanding of signal transmission over long distances.
