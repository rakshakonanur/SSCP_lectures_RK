## Advanced Transmission Line Theory

**Oliver Heaviside** began his work on transmission line theory, advancing our understanding of signal propagation.

### Wave Propagation Theory

Introduced the concept that signals don't just diffuse but also travel as waves along transmission lines.

**Key Insight:** Combined diffusion and wave propagation effects to create a more complete model of signal transmission.

### Beyond Kelvin's Model

Advanced understanding by recognizing the dual nature of signal propagation on transmission lines.

| Kelvin's Approach | Heaviside's Approach |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Diffusion Only    | Diffusion + Waves   |
| Heat equation analogy | Electromagnetic wave theory |
| Limited accuracy | Improved predictions |
