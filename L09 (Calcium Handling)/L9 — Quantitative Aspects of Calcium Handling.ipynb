    "# Excitation-Contraction Coupling in the Cell\n",
    "\n",
    "Over 200 years ago, Luigi Galvani reported that the leg muscles of dead frogs would twitch if he created an electrical spark. This was the beginning of the study of *excitation-contraction coupling*, the process where electrical activation of a muscle cell causes it to contract. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have so far studied the cellular action potential in detail, and have seen how gated ion channels in the cell membrane are responsible for producing these spontaneous electrical signals. We will now try to understand how depolarization of the membrane can cause the cell to contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "The action potential occurs mainly at the cell membrane, but contraction occurs in the myofilaments within the cell. For exciation and contraction to be coupled, we therefore need some process which can transport the signal from the depolarizing cell membrane, into the cytosol and bind to the myofilaments. It turns out that this signal is mediated by diffusing calcium ions (Ca$^{2+}).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calcium as a signaling molecule\n",
    "\n",
    "The rapid changes in the membrane potential of the cell during an action potential occurs due to electrically charged ions (mainly Na$^+$, K$^+$ and Ca$^{2+}$) passing through ion channels in the membrane. For sodium and potassium, these fluxes have relatively small impacts on the intracellular ion concentrations, and these shift at most a few percent. For calcium, however, the relative change in concentration can enormous, with the cytosolic calcium levels increasing by as much as a thousandfold on the order of tens of milliseconds. This is not because calcium fluxes are much larger in magnitude than sodium and potassium, but rather that the diastolic calcium levels are *incredibly* low, typically as low as ~100 nM, meaning the relative changes in concentrations become much larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rapid increase in calcium concentration in the cell is known as the calcium *transient*. This is because calcium levels decay back to resting levels during repolarization, and so the increased calcium levels occur only *transiently*. Put simply, we can say that this calcium transient is what triggers contraction of the cell. Precisely because the transient is so strong and occurs only during systole, it is a very clear signal in the cell. In comparison, sodium and potassium levels have such small relative shifts that they have poor signal-to-noise ratio.\n",

On the bottom you can see the corresponding cytosolic calcium levels. During the depolarizing phase we see a rapid and drastic increase in cytosolic calcium over tens of milliseconds.

    "<p style=\"margin-bottom:1cm;\"></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to being a signal for contraction, calcium is a signal for a large number of process in the cell, both short term and long term. In the short term, elevated calcium levels can drive the activity of kinases, phosphatases, ion channels, exchangers and transporters. In the long term, elevated levels of calcium can be responsible for function, growth, gene expression, differentiation, remodeling and development of cells. \n",
    "\n",
    "Put simply, calcium makes a lot of stuff happen. In chronic heart disease, calcium handling is often found to be disrupted. In addition, calcium handling is quite different across mammalian species, and understanding these differences can be crucial when using animal models or develop drugs. While calcium is important for a large number of signaling pathways, what we mainly want to focus on right now is how the calcium transient itself is formed, and how it decays back to resting levels.\n",

    "### Force as a function of the calcium transient\n",
    "\n",
    "Contraction of the cell occurs when there is enough free calcium in the cytosol, which can then bind to organelles known as *myofilaments*, causing contraction. The mechanism of force production in the myofilaments is described by *sliding filament theory*, which is the topic of the following lectures. For now we want to simple state that free calcium causes contraction, and that contraction ends once calcium levels drop back down.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, however, that contraction is *not* an all-or-nothing response to calcium. Rather, the strength of contraction is a direct function of the *magnitude* of the calcium transient. We can model this using the Hill equation, using a Hill coefficient of $n=4$ and a half-saturation point of $K_{1/2} = 600$ nM free calcium. If you recall our discussion on the Hill equation, a coefficient of 4 means force production will be sigmoidal, with a steep dependence on the magnitude of the calcium transient. This is shown in Figure 4 below (the smaller inset curve).\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 4 contains two graphs, and the distinction between the two is important. The smaller inset graph shows force production as a function of *free* cytosolic calcium, i.e, the actual concentration $\\rm [Ca^{2+}]_i$. The larger graph shows instead how much calcium we have to *add* to the cytosol to trigger contraction. \n",
    "The difference from the two comes mainly from the fact that the cytosol contains a large number of calcium buffers, that will effectively bind and lower the free calcium levels following any Ca$^{2+}$-influx. We therefore need to add a lot more calcium than what would naively think, to properly trigger contraction.\n",

    "* **The mitochondrion** is the powerhouse of the cell and produces the actual energy required for contraction in the form of ATP. In addition the mitochondria does absorb and extrude a small amount of Ca$^{2+}$ but these quantities are small and usually ignored in models.\n",
    "* **The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR):** The SR is an internal calcium storage inside the cell. The SR consists of a lipid bilayer membrane impermeable to Ca$^{2+}$, just like the external cell membrane. The SR membrane also contains ion channels and pumps for calcium.\n",

    "The cell contains intracellular calcium stores called the SR and the SR membrane has its own calcium channels that can open and release Ca$^{2+}$ into the cytosol. These channels are known as ryanodine recepetors (RyR). However, RyRs cannot sense the depolarizing membrane of the cell, because they are not a part of the membrane. Instead they are triggered to open in response to calcium binding to the cytosolic side of the receptor.\n",

    "\n",
    "The process outlined above repeats for every single beat of the heart. For every action potential there is calcium influx, triggering contraction, and then a decay back to baseline as calcium is pumped back out of the cytosol. This process is sometimes called *calcium cycling*, to emphasize the cyclical manner in which calcium moves back and forth between the different domains. There are some subtle balances in this cycling that is very important for how the cell is regulated.\n",

    "\n",
    "Because all calcium that enters the cell enters into the same domain, NCX and SERCA effectively *compete* for the same calcium when they pump it back out. If one is more active, then the other will get less. However, the calcium that is pumped by the SERCA pump does not leave the cell entirely, but is rather stored in the SR. This stored calcium can then help strengthen the next calcium transient.\n",
    "\n",
    "If *more* calcium is pumped by SERCA than is released by RyR, then the amount of calcium stored in the SR, increases. This is called the *SR load*. If the SR load is higher, then RyR would release more calcium in the next beat, giving stronger transients. If *less* calcium is pumped by SERCA, then the SR load would *decrease*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the heart is continuously pumping, it is clear that the SR load cannot decrease or increase forever. Instead, the system will spontaneously tend towards a balance where the amount of calcium released from the SR is the same amount that is pumped back into the SR by SERCA. The same must then necessarily be through for the L-type and NCX. So unless there are some shift in conditions, and we are at *steady-cycle*, then for each beat of have \n",

And indeed, the best fit of this parameter to mammalian cardiomyocyte is on the order of 0.3 ÂµM, which is a very low concentration, only slightly above the typical resting levels of calcium. This means that SERCA is working at full steam even for small elevations above the baseline. Similarly, because SERCA is high-capacity, we expect $v_{\\rm max}$ to be a big number, as the total net pumping capacity is high.\n",

    "Due to its simplicity, the unidirectional pump model sees quite some use. However, it does have some major issues. The biggest is that it does not care about the SR load whatsoever, in fact, this model predicts SERCA will keep pumping away calcium from the cytosol until there is nothing left. This is not only physiological, it is *unphysical* as it breaks the law of thermodynamics, as you will see from your earlier exploration of the thermodynamics of the pump. Because of these shortcomings, models that use a unidirectional SERCA pump often have to add a phenomenological calcium leak current from the SR into the cytosol to balance the over-active SERCA. This can work in practice, but one always has to be very careful with such models, as they are not guaranteed to behave well with changing conditions."

However, ions can also bind, and unbind without getting transported. With the sheer amount of SERCA molecules inside the cell, this means there is, at any given time, a substantial amount of calcium ions bound to SERCA, thus SERCA is acting like a calcium *buffer*. We will discuss buffers and their effect more in the next lecture. For now, suffice to say that SERCA is the second largest calcium buffer in the cell (i.e., it binds a lot of calcium), and a detailed model should include this.\n",

The model pumps calcium by moving around the four states in a *reaction cycle*, first binding calcium, then transforming, then releasing the bound calcium, then transforming back. The pump velocity will be the *cycling rate* of the model, i.e., the rate at which a full cycle of all four steps occurs.

We then also have four new states in our system of ODEs, which of course also add computational complexity. Models such as these are thus often two complex and costly to be added to full action potential models of the cell, unless someone is specifically studying SERCA dynamics in some capacity. "

    "# Measuring intracellular calcium dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier, you've heard some about how one can constrain electrophysiological models of ion channels and pumps from experimental measurements from for example patch clamp. For internal channels and pumps such as SERCA and RyR this is more complicated, because these channels only appear internally to the cell and so cannot be patch clamped. So how can we measure intracellular calcium dynamics?\n",
    "\n",
    "One method is to add calcium indicators into the cell. These are fluorophores that bind calcium and start to glow. Using optical microscopes, we can then measure the amount of fluroesence to find an estimate of the calcium concentrations within the cell. While calcium indicators are useful, they are also quite tricky to work with, and there are limitations in both the spatial and temporal resolution. In addition, the indicators work by binding calcium, meaning you are adding a buffer into the system which buffers precisely what you are trying to measure, which will obviously impact the measurement (an example of the *observer effect*). Because of this we can also add the buffering capacity of a calcium indicators in models we make that reproduce such experiments to make it easier to compare simulation and experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way one can get insight into the intracellular dynamics, is to measure the sarcolemmal currents which *can be* patch-clamped, such as the NCX. Take for example measuring the SR load of a cell. If we add enough caffeine into the cell, the cell releases all its calcium into the cytosol (caffeine triggers RyR to open). In the cytosol some of this calcium gets pumped back into the SR by SERCA, but as the RyR is open, this just goes right back into the cytosol. The NCX however, is also pumping calcium out of the cell, and this efflux of calcium we can measure through a patch clamp. By integrating this current we get a good estimate of how much calcium was in the cell and SR (in total). This measurement is however, not a *dynamic* measurement, you get a one time measurement, but you have removed all calcium from the cell itself. Effectively you are draining the entire cell of its calcium and measuring how much there is in total. \n",

    "The stoichiometry of an exchange cycle is to allow three sodium ions in, for each calcium transported out. ecause of this, the NCX is responsible for carrying two transmembrane fluxes, a calcium current, and a sodium current.

    "\n",
    "The fact that the NCX is electrogenic when it is pumping calcium also makes it a potential candidate for arrythmeogenic behavior of the cell, i.e., abnormal electrical behavior. If the cytosolic calcium concentration of the cell is too high at rest, the NCX will be active and pump calcium out of the cell, however, because three sodium ions are let in for each calcium that is pumped out, the NCX carries an inward current that is depolarizing the cell. Under normal conditions, this occurs during the repolarizing phase of the action potential, and the inward current is more than accounted for by other outward currents, such as potassium. In abnormal cases, however, the NCX can potentially be strong enough to depolarize the cell enough to trigger a new action potential. A sudden and spontaneous release of calcium from the SR while the cell is at rest for example, could potentially trigger an AP. And such spontaneous releases *do* occur (typically called *calcium waves*). The NCX is therefore an important actor in arrythemogenesis and disease."

    "As we discussed earlier, the balance between SERCA and NCX is an important factor in EC coupling, because this balance is what decides the SR load of the cell, which in turn shifts the calcium transient. One direct way of regulating EC coupling is thus to up- or down-regulate SERCA. SERCA is regulated by a molecule called *phospholamban* (PLB), which inhibits SERCA activity. You can think of PLB as the brakes on SERCA, and under normal conditions, these \"brakes\" are partially on.\n",

    "Both PKA and CaMKII are involved in several signaling cascades in the body, but perhaps the most important one is the beta-adrenergic response that occurs when $\\beta$-receptors on the outside of the cell react to epinephrine (adrenaline) or norepinephrine. When this happens ATP gets converted to cyclic AMP (cAMP) which in turn activates PKA and CaMKII starting many different signaling pathways, including upregulating SERCA. In addition $\\beta$-adrenergic stimulus increases the amount of calcium that enters through L-type channels, and make myofilaments more sensitive to calcium.

    "### Auto-regulation\n",
    "\n",
    "As a last example to discuss for intracellular calcium handling for this time, let us look at how cardiomyoyctes to a certain extent as *self-regulating*. Below we show some figures taken from some experiments performed at the institute of experimental medical research at Oslo university hospital.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this experiment they are pacing a cardiomyocyte at a regular pace and measuring the amount of shortening per beat. The shortening is a measure of the strength of contraction, and thus a function of the magnitude of the calcium transient. When pacing at a regular pace, we observe the shortening is fairly constant. This is because the cell is in a steady cycle, and thus the transients produced per action potential are roughly the same magnitudes. But what happens when a bit of caffine is added? \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adding caffine\n",
    "\n",
    "Caffine binds to the calcium release channels (RyR), increasing their calcium sensitivity, making them more likely to open. This in turn gives a bigger calcium release and therefore a bigger transient. This response is very fast, as we can see from the trace.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, after caffine has been added, the system is no longer in a steady cycle, but adjusting every consecutive beat. What we witness is that while the beats do indeed lead to a bigger shortening, the *increase* is decaying for every beat with the shortening slowly reverting to the pre-caffine levels. This is not due to any manipulations from our side, it is a pure autoregulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Trying to think through what is happening can now be a very good summary of todays lecture.\n",

    "<center><div style=\"max-width:550px; word-wrap:break-word;\">\n",
    "<b>Figure 16:</b>\n",
    "A cardiomyocyte is paced at a regular interval, and the resulting cell shortening is measured as a proxy of strength of contraction. Caffine is then added to the cell to sensitize RyR, giving a stronger calcium release. We see that this gives a stronger contraction in the short term, but over a series of beats the cell gradually autoregulates to the same baseline. The reverse situation happens once caffine gets taken off the system again. [Adapted from Sjaastad et al., 2003]\n",
    "</div></center>\n",
    "<p style=\"margin-bottom:1cm;\"></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand *why* the system autoregulates to the previous baseline, you need to consider where calcium is coming from and going. The caffine increased the RyR-mediated release calcium, but the balance of NCX and SERCA is *not* shifted. This means some of the additional calcium released from the SR is pumped out of the cell. While caffine increases the strength of contraction, it does so at the expense of SR load. As SR load drops, so does the transient. Put simply, the system with added caffine is not in equilibrium, and so over time it drifts back to its old magnitudes, albeit with a lower overall SR load.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also why the calcium transient becomes much smaller when we take of the caffine again. In that case the RyR are no longer sensitized, but we still have a low SR load. The SR release is therefore quite weak and the shortening become small. However, because little calcium is released from the SR, more calcium is entering through the L-type in comparison, and so the SR load is gradually refilling over time until the system has drifted back to the old equilibrium.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adding tetracaine\n",
    "\n",
    "The same authors carried out the same experiment, but adding *tetracaine*  instead of caffine, which has the opposite effect on RyR, it inhibits release. Right after adding tetracaine to the system, the calcium release is much weaker, giving a small calcium transient and little shortening. However, over the next 10â€“20 beats, the cell is auto-regulating by increasing its SR load, until we are back to nearly the same baseline as we started at. Taking tetracaine off the system gives the same behavior as when removing caffine, the increased SR load gives a larger shortening, but after some time the SR load has decreased back to its original value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this experiment they also measured both the L-type current and the NCX current of the cell, which when summed gives us a measure of the total amount of calcium entering and leaving the cell. We see that this measurement at baseline goes to 0 over one beat (measured points at a and c). This means there is no net calcium entering or leaving the cell, and thus the SR load is constant. However, after perturbing the system, we see that the integral does *not* go to 0. This means a net amount of calcium is either entering or leaving the cell (entering at point b, and leaving at point d). This calcium cannot be in the cytosol, so it has to end up in the SR.\n",

    "<b>Figure 16b:</b>\n",
    "Adding Tetracaine to the cardiomyocyte inhibits SR calcium release, giving a smaller overall calcium transient. But due to an increasing SR load, the cell autoregulates back to the same baseline contraction. The experimentalists have also added patch-clamp data from L-type and NCX to find the net calcium transport into/out of the cell. This is a good confirmation that our explanation of intracellular calcium handling is a reasonable explanation of the observed cell behavior. <br>\n",
