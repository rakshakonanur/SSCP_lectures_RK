    "Here we will work through the stiffness distortion crossbridge model proposed in 2000 by Maria V. Razumova, Anna E. Bukatina, and Kenneth B. Campbell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model represents a half sarcomere, and relies on the assumption that the force generated in a given sarcomere unit is equal to the sum of forces of each individual crossbridge (XB) in the region. The model also represents force as the product of the stiffness of all parallel cross bridges and their average distortion.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we can represent the force of a half sarcomere as: \n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\n",
    "F(t) = e\\sum_{i=1}^{n}A_i(t)x_i(t)\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Where e is the stiffness of a XB, $A_i(t)$ is the number of XBs in the $i$th state, and $x_i(t)$ average distortion of XBs in the $i$th state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both $A_i$ and $x_i$ vary in time, and should depend on a number of important mechanisms such as Calcium availability, filament overlap, regulatory protein dynamics, and XB kinetics. For this model, the authors focused on the latter 2 mechanisms and held filament overlap and $[Ca^{2+}]$ constant."

    "Using inspection and our knowledge of mass-action kinetics, we can write  ODEs for the system:\n",

    "Mass conservation tells us that $R_{off}(t) = R_T-{D}(t)- A_1(t)-A_2(t)$ where $R_T$ represents the total number of crossbridges for a particular filament overlap fraction. Though the model does not consider filament overlap, one could introduce length-dependence into the model by adjusting $R_T$.\n",
