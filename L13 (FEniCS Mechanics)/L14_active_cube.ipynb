    "Soft biological tissues typically follow an exponential stress-strain relation. This relation was originally described by Fung, and has been implemented in a wide range of models for isotropic and anisotropic tissues. One of the most widely used material models for passive cardiac tissue is the model of Guccione et al from 1995. Several versions of the model have been used in the literature. We apply a transversely isotropic and nearly incompressible version, with strain energy given by:\n",

    "## Step 1: Replace the StVenant-Kirchhoff material model\n",
    "Modify the code above to use the Guccione material model. You can implement the strain energy function directly yourself, or you can use an existing Python class which can be found here:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Guccione model (1995)](./guccionematerial.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "The class supports both fully incompressible and nearly incompressible models. The key part is the function named `strain_energy`, which defines the strain energy as a function of the deformation gradient $F$. \n",
    "\n",
    "An important difference between the StVenant-Kirchhoff material and the Guccione model is that the Guccione model is anisotropic, meaning that the material properties are different in different directions. The material model therefore needs to know about the local tissue microstructure, i.e., the orientation of the fiber-, sheet- and sheet normal directions. For flexibility and generality, our material model class takes these vectors (or vector fields) as input parameters, as can be seen in the class' constructor.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In our simple unit cube, it is natural to define the fiber direction as parallel with the x-axis, the sheet direction parallel with the y-axis, and the normal direction parallel with the z-axis. Code for defining these vectors can look as follows:"
