    "## Networks\n",
    "As the field of computational neuroscience continues to evolve, the necessity to comprehend \n",
    "and simulate the dynamic interactions within neural networks becomes increasingly important. \n",
    "Network dynamics, which involves understanding how various interconnected nodes in a network \n",
    "interact over time, is a way to modelling and studying complex systems, including the \n",
    "intricate neural networks of the brain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the various neuron models available, the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model \n",
    "serves as a simplified yet effective way to understand the fundamental properties of \n",
    "neurons and their interactions. While the LIF model does not capture the full complexity \n",
    "of real neurons, its relative simplicity allows it to be used extensively in large-scale \n",
    "simulations of neural networks, making it a widely adopted tool for exploring network dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "One largly influental study of network dynamics in neuroscience [Brunel2000], explored the \n",
    "different modes of network activity: asynchronous irregular (AI), asynchronous regular (AR), \n",
    "synchronous regular (SR), and synchronous irregular (SI). \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Asynchronous Irregular (AI) Mode:** This represents a state where neural firings are \n",
    "scattered randomly in time and across neurons. It is believed to be the mode of activity \n",
    "during most wakeful states and has been linked to the processing of complex stimuli and \n",
    "behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Asynchronous Regular (AR) Mode:** In AR mode, neurons fire at a regular interval but \n",
    "out of phase with each other, meaning that each neuron fires independently. \n",
    "This mode might be involved in independent processing or simultaneous execution of \n",
    "separate tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Synchronous Regular (SR) Mode:** In this mode, neurons fire synchronously at \n",
    "regular intervals. It is often associated with oscillatory activities in the brain \n",
    "such as theta and gamma rhythms, which are important for memory and perception, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Synchronous Irregular (SI) Mode:** Here, neurons fire synchronously but at irregular \n",
    "intervals. This mode of activity is less understood but may be important for certain transient \n",
    "brain states or responses to specific stimuli.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these modes of network activity, and using simulations of LIF neurons to study \n",
    "their properties and transitions, is a powerful approach to analyzing complex brain processes. \n",
    "It allows for a deeper understanding of network dynamics and how they contribute to various \n",
    "cognitive functions, and also provides a useful tool for developing artificial intelligence \n",
    "systems that emulate the human brain.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the mechanics of LIF neurons, the AI, \n",
    "AR, SR, and SI modes of activity, and their implications for network dynamics and \n",
    "computational neuroscience."

    "### Exercise: Simulation of Integrate-and-Fire Neuron Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective: Simulate and analyze the different modes of operation in an integrate-and-fire \n",
    "neuron model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement an integrate-and-fire neuron model in Python. Your neuron should be able to \n",
    "summate a large number of synaptic inputs and generate action potentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create two types of inputs for your neuron: excitatory and inhibitory. \n",
    "Each input should consist of an independent Poisson spike train driving a synaptic conductance. \n",
    "For this exercise, let's consider 1000 excitatory and 200 inhibitory inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, simulate two different scenarios to illustrate the two different modes of operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. In the first scenario, the excitatory inputs should be strong enough relative to the \n",
    "inhibitory inputs to make the average membrane potential more depolarized than the spiking \n",
    "threshold of the model. Record the pattern of action potentials generated by your neuron model \n",
    "in this condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. In the second scenario, the average membrane potential should be more hyperpolarized than \n",
    "the threshold for action potential generation. Again, record the pattern of action potentials \n",
    "generated in this condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plot the membrane potentials for both scenarios. \n",
    "You should turn off the action potential generation mechanism of the model for these plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the Coefficient of Variation (CV) for the inter-spike intervals of the output spike \n",
    "trains in both scenarios. The CV is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean of the \n",
    "inter-spike intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyze and compare the regularity of the spike trains in both scenarios. \n",
    "Discuss how the neuron model effectively averages its many synaptic inputs and how this \n",
    "impacts the regularity of the output spike train.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discuss the implications of your findings. How does the mode of operation affect the neuron's \n",
    "ability to reflect the temporal properties of fluctuations in total synaptic input? How might \n",
    "this relate to the variability seen in in vivo recordings of cortical neurons?"
